     * coordinates expressed in the target frame for the input point are returned. This 
     * transformation of spherical coordinates are using a <b>3d point</b>, and thus will also
     * take into account the relative translation between the source and target frame.</li>
     * <li>If only azimuth and elevation are given (distance set to zero [0] or nan [Double.NaN]),

     * translation between the source and target frame is ignored, and only their relative
     * orientation is taken into account.</li>
