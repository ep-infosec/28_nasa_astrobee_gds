/**
 * Spherical stores coordinates of a point expressed in azimuth, 
 * elevation and distance.
 * 
 * The convention for spherical is the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Both azimuth and elevation angles are expressed in radians.
 * <li>The azimuth angle is measured around the Z axis, from the X axis to the projection of the point on the X-Y plane</li>
 * <li>The elevation angle is measured from the X-Y plane to the point, positive on the side of positive Z values.
 * <li>Distance should always be positive. 
 * </ul>
 * <i>Note: the last rule is not enforced by the code, but creating Spherical with 
 * negative distance would lead to unexpected and likely wrong result!</i>
 * 
 * This class is a simple extension of the Vector3, with specific access
 * for safety.
