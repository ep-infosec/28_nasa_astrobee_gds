IMPORTANT:

There is a bug in the 3.5 version of org.eclipse.core.databinding.beans that prevents master-detail databinding 
from working for any fields which are not of type String.  

The workaround is to use the latest, 3.6 version of that plugin which I have checked in.  
When we finally upgrade to 3.6, we will drop this.

Please contact me with any questions
